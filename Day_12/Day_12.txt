Step 1: Go to EC2 Dashboard
		Login to AWS Console
		Select region us-east-1
		Go to EC2 → Volumes

Step 2: Select the Volume
		Find the volume named datacenter-volume
		Select the volume
		Click Actions → Attach volume

Step 3: Attach Volume
		Instance: select mentioned_instance
		Device name: /dev/sdb   ----(Select the required type and proceed)
		Click Attach
		Volume is now attached successfully.

Explanation: 	
What is a Volume in AWS?

In AWS, Volume usually means EBS Volume.
EBS = Elastic Block Store

An EBS volume is persistent block storage for EC2 instances.

Key properties:

	Data persists even if EC2 stops
	Can be attached / detached
	Can be snapshotted
	Can be reattached to another EC2

	Types of EBS Volumes
	Type	Use Case
	gp3			General purpose (most common)
	io1/io2		High-performance databases
	st1			Big data, throughput
	sc1			Cold storage

How EC2 & Volumes are USED in DevOps (Real-Time)

1)Hosting Applications

	EC2 runs:
		Java apps
		Node.js
		Python
		Jenkins

	EBS stores:
		App data
		Logs
		Uploads

2)	Zero-Downtime Scaling
	Problem:
	Disk full while app is running

	Solution:
	Create EBS volume
	Attach to running EC2
		Mount to /data
		No downtime
		Production safe

3️	Database Storage
	Example:
		MySQL on EC2
		EC2 → DB process
		EBS → DB data directory

	If EC2 crashes:
		Attach volume to new EC2
		DB resumes

4️	Backup & Disaster Recovery
	Take EBS snapshots
	Restore volumes
	Attach to new EC2

	Used in:
		DR
		Migration
		Rollback

5️	CI/CD & DevOps Tools
	Jenkins Server:
		EC2 runs Jenkins
		EBS stores:
		Jenkins jobs
		Build artifacts
		Maven cache
		
7️	Kubernetes / Containers
	EKS pods use EBS-backed persistent volumes
	Same EC2 + EBS concept, automated



		
		
In DevOps and cloud, attaching volumes to running EC2 instances allows dynamic storage management, zero-downtime scaling, disaster recovery, and separation of compute and storage, which is critical for highly available and scalable systems.
