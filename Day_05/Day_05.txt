Elastic block storage : 

Amazon EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances. 
Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them just like you would use block storage. 
Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect from the failure of a single component.





Key Features
	1.Persistent Storage
		Your data stays safe regardless of EC2 instance state.

	2.High Availability & Durability
		Automatically replicated within an Availability Zone (AZ).

	3.Snapshots
		You can take EBS snapshots (backups) stored in S3.

	4.Scalable
		Increase volume size, performance, or type without downtime (in most cases).

	5.Encrypted by Default
		Supports KMS-based encryption to secure your data.

Types of EBS Volumes

	gp3	 (General Purpose SSD) 									---— Most common used
	gp2	 (Older general-purpose SSD)
	io2	 / io1 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)							---— High-performance workloads
	st1	 (Throughput-optimized HDD) 							---— Big data, logs
	sc1	 (Cold HDD) 											—--- Infrequent access, lowest cost

Common Use Cases

	-	Boot volume for EC2 instances
	-	Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
	-	Application data storage
	-	Log and analytics storage
	-	Container storage for ECS/EKS


Difference : (EBS , EFS and S3)
	EBS → Fast disk for one server
	EFS → Shared file system for many servers
	S3 → Large, durable storage accessible from anywhere
