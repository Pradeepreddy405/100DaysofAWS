Elastic ip's

	In AWS, Elastic IP (EIP) is a static, public IPv4 address that you can allocate and attach to an Amazon EC2 instance or other AWS resources like.
		1. EC2 Instance
		2. Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
		3. NAT Gateway
		4. Network Load Balancer (NLB
		
		
	Key components
		Static address				: Unlike a regular public IP, an EIP does not change when you stop or start your instance.
		Re-mappable					: You can quickly reassign an EIP from one instance to another—useful during failures or maintenance.
		Public (internet-reachable)	: It allows inbound/outbound traffic from the internet.
		
	Why Use an Elastic IP?
	
		To keep a persistent public IP for applications or servers.
		To enable high availability by remapping the IP to a standby instance.
		To avoid DNS changes when instances are replaced.
