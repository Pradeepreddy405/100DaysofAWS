Day 1: Create Key Pair

Log in to AWS Console
	Login with provided credentials according to task
	
Set the Region
	Ensure the region at the top right is N. Virginia (us-east-1).
	
Navigate to EC2
	In the AWS Console, search for EC2 and open it.
	
Create Key Pair
	In the left sidebar, scroll down to Network & Security.
	Click Key Pairs.
	Click Create key pair.
	
Configure the Key Pair
	Name: datacenter-kp
	Key pair type: RSA
	File format: Choose .pem (or .ppk if you're using PuTTY)
	Leave the rest as default.
	
Create
	Click Create key pair.
	The private key file will automatically download.

What Is a Key Pair in AWS?
	A key pair in AWS is a set of two cryptographic keys used for secure login to EC2 instances:

1.	Public Key		----> Stored by AWS.
	Embedded into your EC2 instance when it launches.

2.	Private Key		----> Downloaded and kept by you.
	Used to authenticate your connection to the instance.
	Must be protected—AWS cannot recreate it.

		NOTE: Together, they enable SSH authentication using a method called public-key cryptography.
		
=============================================================================================================

Why Are Key Pairs Important?

	Provide passwordless authentication.
	Ensure only someone with the private key can access the instance.
	Protect your servers from unauthorized access.
	They replace traditional passwords, which are more vulnerable.

How Key Pairs Are Used in AWS EC2

	When you launch a Linux EC2 instance:
		AWS places your public key inside the instance (usually in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys).

	When you try to connect using SSH:
		You provide your private key file (.pem or .ppk) [ssh -i name_of_key.pem ec2-user@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>]
		The server checks if it matches the public key stored inside.

	If they match, you are authenticated automatically.

For Windows EC2 instances:

Key pairs are used to decrypt the administrator password, not SSH.

=============================================================================================================

What the Task Required You to Do

In the task, you were asked to:

	Create a key pair in AWS
	Name it datacenter-kp
	Ensure the key type is RSA
	Create it in us-east-1 region

This prepares a secure method for connecting to EC2 instances later in the DevOps labs.

Why This Matters in a Migration Project

During cloud migration:
	DevOps teams frequently launch new EC2 instances.
	They need secure, scalable access to those servers.
	Key pairs provide a safe method to log in without exposing passwords.

Key pairs help enforce:
	Security best practices,
	Access control,
	Auditing and compliance,
	Automation (Terraform, Ansible, CI/CD pipelines).
