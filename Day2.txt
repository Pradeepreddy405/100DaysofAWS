Create a Security Group via AWS Management Console  

1.	Open the Amazon EC2 Console
	Go to EC2 Dashboard.
	In the left sidebar, click Security Groups (under “Network & Security”).

2. 	Create a new security group
	Click Create security group.

3. 	Configure basic details
	Name		: Give your security group a meaningful name.
	Description	: Describe its purpose (e.g., “Allow HTTP and SSH”).
	VPC			: Select the VPC where this security group will be used.

4. 	Go the security group Add inbound rules
	Click Add rule.
	Choose a type (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, Custom TCP, etc.).
	Set the port range.
	Choose the source:
	0.0.0.0/0 → open to the internet         -----> Default (if you want more secure - choose Specific IP - You can able to connect to virtual machine only that specifi choosen ip)
	Another security group 					 -----> for internal traffic

5. 	Add outbound rules
	By default, AWS allows all outbound traffic.
	You can modify if needed.

6. 	Create the security group
	Click Create security group.




What are security groups ?
	In AWS, Security Groups are virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to your resources—most commonly EC2 instances, but also RDS databases, Lambda functions in VPCs, ECS tasks, etc.


What Security Groups Do ?

	1. Control Traffic at the Instance Level
		Security groups act like stateful firewalls attached to network interfaces (ENIs).
		They determine what traffic can enter (inbound rules) and leave (outbound rules) a resource.

	2. 	They Are Stateful
		If you allow inbound traffic on a port, the response traffic is automatically allowed to flow back, even if there's no corresponding outbound rule — and vice-versa.


What is an Elastic Network Interface (ENI)?
	An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual network card within your Amazon VPC. It represents a logical networking component that you can attach to EC2 instances.
	
	Key components : 
	Virtual Network Card:
	Acts like the network interface of a physical server but is completely software-defined.

	Lives in a VPC:
	ENIs exist inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and operate within its subnets, routing tables, and security rules.

	Availability Zone Bound:
	An ENI can only be attached to EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone where it was created.

	Attachable to EC2 Instances:
	You can attach one or more ENIs to an EC2 instance, depending on the instance type.

	ENIs can be configured with:
		- Primary private IPv4 address
		- Multiple secondary IPv4 addresses
		- Elastic IPs (mapped to private IPs)
		- IPv6 addresses
		- Security groups
		- MAC address
		- Description and tags
