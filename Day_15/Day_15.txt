Create EBS Snapshot via AWS Console 

Step 1: Login & Select Region
		Log in to AWS Management Console
		From the top-right corner, select Region: <region_>

Step 2: Open EC2 Volumes
		Go to Services → EC2
		In the left sidebar, scroll down to Elastic Block Store
		Click Volumes

Step 3: Select the Volume
		In the volumes list, find the volume with Name = nautilus-vol
		(Check the Tags → Name column)
		Select the volume (checkbox)
		
Step 4: Create Snapshot
		Click Actions
		Choose Create snapshot

Step 5: Fill Snapshot Details
		In the Create snapshot screen:
Description:
		<Snap_shot_name> Snapshot

		Tags:
		Key: Name
		Value: <Snap_shot_name>
		Click Create snapshot

Step 6: Monitor Snapshot Status
		In the left sidebar, click Snapshots
		Locate the snapshot with Name = required snapshot that you wanted to mention
		Wait until Status changes from pending → completed


Step 7: Final Verification

		Confirm:
		Snapshot Name: required snapshot that you wanted to mention
		Description: nautilus Snapshot
		State: completed
		Region: us-east-1
		
		
What is a Snapshot in AWS?
	In AWS, a snapshot is a point-in-time backup of data stored on an Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume.
	
	Restore the same data
	Create a new volume
	Copy data to another region
	Recover from failures
	
	
	


Incremental means:

	First snapshot → full backup
	Next snapshots → only changed blocks

Why Do We Use Snapshots?
		1: Backup & Data Protection
					If something goes wrong:
					Accidental deletion
					Disk corruption
					App crash
					Ransomware
					Snapshot allows fast recovery

		2️: Disaster Recovery (DR)
					Restore volumes after EC2 failure
					Recover from AZ or Region issues

					Example:
					EC2 crashed → Create new EC2 → Attach volume from snapshot

3️: Easy Volume Restoration

You can:

Create a new EBS volume from a snapshot
Attach it to any EC2
No need to reinstall OS or app data again.

4️: Cross-Region & Cross-Account Copy
Copy snapshots to another AWS region
Share snapshots across AWS accounts



DevOps Use Cases - Very Important

1: Automated Backups (Most Common)
		DevOps teams automate snapshots using:
		AWS Data Lifecycle Manager
		Lambda + CloudWatch
		Terraform

Example:
		Daily snapshot at 2 AM
		Retain for 7 days
		Delete old ones automatically

2️ CI/CD Environment Cloning

	In DevOps pipelines:
		Take snapshot of QA DB
		Create new volume
		Attach to Staging

		Fast environment replication
		Consistent data

3️ Rollback Strategy
	Before deployment:
		Take snapshot -> Deploy new version -> If failure  restore snapshot
		Very common in:
			Database servers
			Legacy apps
			Stateful workloads

4️ Blue-Green & Canary Deployments
	Snapshots help in:
		Rolling back data changes
		Safe production deployments

		Example:
		Prod DB snapshot → Deploy → If error → Restore

5️ Security & Compliance
	Retain snapshots for audits
	Encrypted snapshots
	Meet compliance (ISO, SOC, HIPAA)

6️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

	Used with:
		Terraform
		CloudFormation

		Example:
		
		resource "aws_ebs_snapshot" "backup" {
		volume_id = "vol-xxxx"	
		}

7️: Migration Use Case
		Snapshot → copy to another region
		Create volume → attach to new EC2

	Used during:
		Data center migration
		Region migration

	Real-World Example (DevOps)
	E-commerce App
		MySQL running on EC2 + EBS
		Daily snapshots at midnight
		Weekly copy to another region
		Restore used during failed deployments


summary :
		AWS Snapshot is an incremental, point-in-time backup of EBS volumes used for backup, recovery, automation, and disaster recovery in DevOps workflows.
