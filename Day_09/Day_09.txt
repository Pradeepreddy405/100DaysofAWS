" Termination protection " is an EC2 safety feature that prevents accidental deletion of critical instances. It can be enabled via console or CLI

Explanation :
		In real-time DevOps, termination protection is used as a safety guard for production EC2 instances. It prevents accidental deletion via console, CLI, Terraform, or CI/CD pipelines. 
		It is typically enforced on critical infra like Jenkins masters, databases, and legacy apps, and combined with IAM or SCP for governance.”

Real-Time Scenario: Production Safety

	- Production EC2 (database, Jenkins master, legacy app)
	- Multiple engineers + CI/CD pipelines
	- Automation using Terraform / Jenkins / Ansible
	
This blocks:
	- Manual deletion
	- CI/CD pipeline deletion
	- Terraform destroy
