What Is a Subnet?

	A subnet is a range of IP addresses within your VPC. You place AWS resources—like EC2 instances, RDS databases, or load balancers—into subnets.

		(or)

	In AWS, subnets are subdivisions of a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) that let you organize and isolate resources within your cloud network.
	
Types of Subnets
		1. Public Subnet
			Has a route to the Internet Gateway (IGW).
			Resources inside can be reached from the internet (if they have public IPs).
			Typical use: web servers, bastion hosts, load balancers.

		2. Private Subnet
			No direct route to the internet.
			Often routes outbound traffic via a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance.
			Typical use: application servers, databases, internal services.

		3. Isolated Subnet (sometimes called “local-only”)
			No internet access at all (no IGW, no NAT).
			High-security workloads.
			
Why Use Subnets?

		Security isolation (use different route tables and security groups).
		High availability (subnets span one Availability Zone—so you create multiple for redundancy).
		Traffic control (public vs private routing).
		Organizing workloads (e.g., separate subnets for web, app, DB layers).
		
		

Subnets_Use_cases
		
1.Public Subnets – Hosting Internet-Facing Services

		Used for:
		Application Load Balancer (ALB)
		API Gateway private integrations
		NAT Gateways
		Bastion hosts
		Web servers (less common today—prefer private + ALB)
		
		Real scenario:
		A Cloud Architect designs a system where the:
		ALB sits in a public subnet.
		ALB forwards traffic to EC2/ECS/EKS nodes in private subnets.
		This ensures servers are not exposed directly to the internet.
		
		🟩 2. Private Subnets – Secure Backend Workloads
		
		Used for:		
		EC2 app servers		
		ECS tasks		
		EKS nodes and pods		
		Redis/ElastiCache		
		RDS databases
		Internal microservices
		Internal load balancers
		
		DevOps perspective:
		Deploy Kubernetes nodes in private subnets.
		Pods communicate internally, and outbound access goes through NAT Gateway.
		
		Why?
		Security
		Isolation
		Compliance
		
3. Database Subnets (Private + No Route to Internet)
		
		Used for:
		RDS Multi-AZ DB subnet groups
		Aurora clusters
		Highly sensitive data stores
		
		Real scenario:
		A Cloud Architect creates a DB Subnet Group with subnets in different AZs to ensure high availability.
		
		DB subnets NEVER have:
		public IPs
		routes to the internet
		Only app servers in private subnets can reach the DB.
		
4. NAT Subnets – Enabling Outbound Internet for Private Resources
		
		Used for:
		
		Allow private EC2/ECS/EKS nodes to download packages
		Patching and updates
		External API calls
		
		Real example:
		DevOps pipeline deploys app servers.
		Servers are in private subnets.
		They install dependencies via NAT Gateway in a public subnet.
		
5. Subnet Segmentation for Microservices
		
		Microservices architecture often uses multiple private subnet tiers:
		Private subnet (App Tier A) → Service A
		Private subnet (App Tier B) → Service B
		Database subnet → DB tier
		Traffic flows only between necessary tiers by SG rules.
		
		Used in:
		
		Banking apps
		Fintech
		E-commerce microservices
		
6. Subnet Design for High Availability and Fault Tolerance
		
		Cloud Architects ALWAYS design subnets across multiple AZs.
		
		Example layout:
		
		VPC
		├── Public Subnets		:   us-east-1a, 1b
		├── Private App Subnets	: us-east-1a, 1b
		└── Private DB Subnets	: us-east-1a, 1b
				
		Note : This ensures the system stays up even if one AZ goes down.
		
7. DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Use Cases (Subnet Selection)
		
		DevOps engineers choose subnets for:
		CodeBuild network config
		EKS node groups
		ECS Fargate tasks
		Lambda functions in VPC
		
		Example:
		
		A Lambda function accessing RDS must run in:
		private subnets
		that have NAT Gateway (for external calls)
		
8. Subnet Use in Hybrid Cloud & VPN
		
		For on-prem connectivity:
		Create special private subnets that route traffic to VPN/Direct Connect.
		Used for internal corporate apps.
		
		Example:
		A banking system with:
		App servers in AWS private subnet
		Mainframe in on-prem
		Connected via Direct Connect
		
9. Subnet Use in Security/Compliance (PCI, HIPAA, SOC2)
		
		To pass audits, organizations must:
		Segregate front-end, app, and DB workloads
		Restrict traffic between subnets
		Create “isolated” subnets without a NAT
		
		Used by:
		Payment processors
		Healthcare apps
		Govt workloads
		
10. Subnet Use in EKS (Kubernetes)
		Typical real setup:
		Public subnets → for ALB ingress controllers
		Private subnets → worker nodes
		Isolated subnets → for internal services (no NAT)
