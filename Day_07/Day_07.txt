1. 	Ensure EC2 Status Checks are complete
	Before making any changes, confirm:
	Instance state: running
	Status checks: 2/2 checks passed

	How to check:
	
	Go to AWS Console > EC2 > Instances
	Select specified instance that you wanted to change

	Look at the Status Checks column
	If it's “Initializing”, wait until it becomes 2/2 checks passed

2. 	Stop the EC2 instance
	You must stop an EC2 instance before changing the instance type.
	
	Steps:
	Select specified or required instance

	Click Instance State → Stop instance
	Confirm and wait until state becomes stopped

3. 	Change the instance type
	Now modify the instance type, With the instance selected:

	Click Actions 	-> Instance settings -> Change instance type
	Choose t2.nano 	-> save the changes

4. 	Start the instance
	Start it again:
	Instance State → Start instance

	Wait until:
	State = running
	Status Checks = 2/2 checks passed
	
	
	
Why stopping is required:

	- To detach the instance from its current hardware
	- To move/allocate it to a new physical host with different capabilities
	- To avoid data corruption and instability
	
Changing an instance type is a very common operational task in DevOps and cloud while performing below things
	
1. 	Resource Optimization (Right-sizing)
	Companies constantly adjust instances to reduce cost.

Example:
	-> If CPU utilization is only 10% → downgrade instance (cheaper)
	-> If instance is throttling → upgrade instance (more power)

This is exactly what happened in your scenario:
Instance underutilized → downgrade to t2.nano


 	Cost Reduction & Cloud Efficiency
	AWS bills per instance type.
	Changing instance size is one of the easiest cost-saving activities.
	Downsize non-critical workloads
	Upsize production systems during peak load

2. Auto Scaling & Performance Management

	Sometimes DevOps adjusts instance types due to:
	Traffic changes
	Scaling strategies
	Application updates needing more resources

3. Migration Between Regions / Upgrading
	During migrations, teams often:
	Move workloads
	Change instance families (T to M to C, etc.)
	Improve performance or reduce costs
	Stopping the instance is part of that workflow.
