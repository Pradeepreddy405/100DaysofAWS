What is an Elastic IP?

	An Elastic IP is a static, public IPv4 address provided by AWS that does not change, even if:
	-	EC2 is stopped/started
	-	Instance is replaced
	-	App is redeployed

	Why elastic ips remains constant : Elastic IPs remain constant by design, because AWS treats them very differently from normal public IPs.Elastic IPs are allocated to your AWS account, not to the EC2 instance or underlying hardware.
		Detached
		Re-attached
		Moved to another instance

	Caution:
		-	Normal public IPs change on a stop–start cycle releases the public IP because the underlying host may change.
		-	It doesn't change on reboot -  Reboot does not change public IP because the ENI remains intact.”

Where Elastic IPs used ?

	Real-world scenarios:
	
		Production servers
		Jenkins master
		Bastion host
		VPN server
