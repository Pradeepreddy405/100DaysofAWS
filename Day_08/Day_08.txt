What is EC2 Stop Protection?

	EC2 Stop Protection prevents your EC2 instance from being accidentally stopped.
	If stop protection is enabled:
		
			You cannot stop the instance from AWS Console or CLI
			You will get an error: “The instance is not allowed to stop”
	Caution:		
		Stop protection DOES NOT prevent termination.
		For preventing accidental termination, you must enable termination protection separately.
	
To avoid situations like:

	- Someone accidentally stops a production server
	- Auto-scaling scripts or CI/CD pipelines mistakenly stop the instance
	- DevOps misclicks "Stop" instead of "Reboot"
